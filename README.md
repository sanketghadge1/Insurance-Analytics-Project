# Insurance-Analytics-Project
In this project, we analyze insurance claims data to find trends, detect fraud, and understand customer behavior. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI/Tableau, we create reports and visuals to help insurance companies make better decisions, reduce risks, and improve services.
